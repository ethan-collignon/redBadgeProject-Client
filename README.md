#H1 Crag, Grub and Camp-Server (ElevenFifty RedBadge Final Project)

This README is for the client side only for our final ElevenFifty Academy project. The larger grand project is designed to put most of everything we have learned in this course as well as coding this project in Typescript and use Class Components only. 

My project idea is to create an application for rock climbers that can be used in conjunction with the popular Mountain Project app. MP is a user content created app and is the main tool climbers use to record specific climbs, get directions to those climbs and has very rough information surrounding climbing adjacent activities like lodging and food. 

With my project I am expanding on those adjacent items by creating a user content created app that records, reviews, rates and gives cost information to campsites and eateries near climbing areas. 

This file specifically builds the client facing side. Users can utilize forms, buttons, routes and navigation to signup or register an account and then leave reviews of their favorite campsites or eateries near where they climbed. All of this forms and buttons link to the previously built server to store and retrieve the information. 

Building this file was very challenging in that we were required to only use Typescript. We were required to build a corresponding client side to the three tables and CRUD functionality that was set in the server.

We also were required to use form validation, pass props, use of setState and react patterns. Many of these were implemented as bi-products of usual use of Class components or React. The form validation was a newer concept that I did need to research and implement. The method I chose was just to add a simple require tag inside each input I wanted validated. This prevents a null user from being created and also gives the user a pop up asking to complete the form. Ideally, I would develop a client side error method for the client to see more specific information.

One aspect of this project that I did need to do extra learning for was the role based access controls. The Client side of this aspect proved a lot more challenging than the server side. I got the idea from a classmate to hide admin behind a navigated link that only the admin can see. This was a great fit for my project.

Overall I felt the client side was extremely difficult and challenging. I had to really dig deep within myself and keep pushing to find resources or get instructor help to solve some of my blocks. In the end, I do feel I have a better understanding for Typescript and Class components.
